# FLYBODY

[View deployed site](https://didisimmons.github.io/Flybody-gym/)

#### Overview of project: 
FLYBODY is a fitness website in Nigeria designed to educate and inspire people about the benefits of fitness and good health. How incorporating an exercise routine into our daily lives might alter our way of life. One of the major issues that fitness websites face in the fitness industry is a lack of sufficient motivation for people to engage in memberships or join fitness programs/workouts.

However, a small fraction of people are eager to begin their fitness adventure. This is FLYBODY’s  target audience; we understand that everyone has different goals, lifestyles and interests. There is no one-size-fits-all workout plan.As a result, we developed several programs to meet the needs of our clients.We are here to understand our clients'needs and provide them with the appropriate programs to assist them reach their various fitness objectives.

We recognize that embarking on a fitness journey can be intimidating at times, especially if you are unsure of what equipment to use or which exercise programs to take.As a result, we are committed to building a fitness community at FLYBODY that provides a safe,entertaining environment for people to bond and form genuine relationships. This community would be focused on inspiring one another to reach their fitness objectives, holding one another accountable, and providing support to one another. 

The website would foster a community in which people could constantly motivate one another and be proud of the benefits of being a member of a gym community.


## Project Goal: 

FLYBODY is a website that encourages people to meet up for workout sessions or personal training on a regular basis. To create a community in which people can constantly motivate, socialize, and hold one another responsible for their fitness goals. The site would target people of all ages who want to stay fit, need motivation to get started, and are searching for a fitness community to join. FLYBODY would show the benefits of joining their community, how to join, and the advantages of FLYBODY over competitors.

## Design

* Colour Scheme

    - The colours used on the site were picked from Glebstock's adobe [palette](www.color.adobe.com/search?q=gym.)
    - FLYBODY's brand is represented by the palette. The colours were chosen to convey trust and honesty to the user throughout the website, as well as cleanliness and simplicity.
* Typography

  - To ensure consistency, the Oswald and EB Garamond fonts are used throughout the site. The two fonts give our site a distinct personality and elegance, as well as an appealing appearance.
* Imagery 

  - The photos featured throughout the site were obtained from free image providers such as Unsplash, Pexels, Pixibay, and so on.
   
   - The photographs portray a modern aesthetic gym where members are having fun using the gym's facilities and equipment, as well as the energy that can be expected there. The graphics' purpose is to draw viewers' attention to the FLY BODY website, where they may register and join the community.

### Wireframes:  

The wireframe for the entire site is available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/8qHDfvLP2VWCYEGpWECjkS/FLYBODY?node-id=0%3A1).  This shows the site on both a desktop and a mobile device, with some tablet view wireframes indicating when the screen view is different and its interactions.


## Features

On each of the five pages, a fully responsive navigation bar has been included. The navigation bar is made up of the gym's emblem on the far left and five different links on the right. On a mobile device, the five individual links condense into a hamburger icon in the menu bar, while the logo on the left side remains unchanged.

Each of the five pages has a footer with information about the head office location, additional locations present, a contact phone number, social media icons for their social media presence, and a call to action button to join FLYBODY's community. The social media links offer the user with a sense of trust and allow for involvement across their channels. The primary goal of the call to action button is to aggressively convert our users into potential clients by shortening the conversion funnel process.

To avoid lack of information/misinformation, a dismissive alert has been added on top of the navigation bar on each of the pages to remind users of new governmental laws due to the third wave of covid-19 that influence the business. 

A hero image with a page header overlay appears on all five pages, including the homepage. The background graphic reflects the experience that can be expected at FLYBODY , as well as capturing the user's attention and keeping them engaged to accomplish a task . The user would have a better experience as a result, and the bounce rate would be lower. 

##### HOME 

A hero image is shown on the homepage to grab the user's attention and keep them engaged with the site. The hero picture is simply a page header overlay with a call to action button. To prevent overloading our viewers, the overlay text has been kept brief, clear, and appealing, with a zoom in effect that appears when the site loads. When a user clicks the call to action button, a sign up form opens without requiring the user to leave the home page. The form just takes 1 minute to complete, and once submitted, the buyer would be led to a thank you page. This page informs the user of their appreciation to join the FLYBODY  community and what happens next. 

Following the hero image is an about section that briefly defines FLYBODY's purpose and vision. This part is separated into two columns, one containing an image of the two female owners and the other containing a brief explanation of FLYBODY. On a mobile device, the image is removed and only the brief description about FLYBODY's brand is displayed. Through the brand's story, this provides users with a background story of FLYBODY, what to expect, and a sense of belonging.

We have a facilities section under the about us part that informs the user of the kind of equipment/facilities available at FLYBODY. This feature shows the user what to expect and what is included when they go to the gym at FLYBODY. If the user agrees to join, they will be able to choose from a variety of equipment options.  

The three primary groups are labelled with titles that provide a brief overview of the group's amenities. A view more button has also been provided to satiate users' interest about the types of equipment available at FLYBODY. If the user clicks the button, he or she will be directed to another website that will display all of the equipment in that group in the future, but for the time being, it will redirect the user to the home page.

More facilities were added to the amenities area to show users the value-added services provided by FLYBODY. The goal of this feature is to entice consumers to join the community by demonstrating to them that we are revolutionizing the fitness business by introducing innovative features that aren't commonly present in the industry. 

The reviews section is located under the more facilities section. Customers who have used the FLYBODY facility offer their thoughts. To visually appeal to users, a female member utilizing gym equipment is featured as a background overlay for the review area. The goal of this part is to acquire the trust of our users, since we realize that feedback is critical to a company's sustainability. This will urge the user to become a member of the FLYBODY community.

The section on why join us is identical to the section on more facilities, however the information offered here is more brief and convincing. In this area, we emphasize the advantages of becoming a member of the FLYBODY community over our competitors ( our competitive advantage). To make it aesthetically appealing for consumers, icons are utilized to describe and underline the benefits of joining FLYBODY. 

The team members section is located under this section. The faces behind the business's operational side are shown in order to acquire the trust of our users and create relationships with our members. For each screen device, the members are positioned differently. The photos of the members are four columns large on a PC, three columns wide on a tablet, and two columns wide on a mobile device. The photos are squared in shape with a curve at each edge, which makes the site visually appealing and clean.

This section's goal is to create trust with members and non-members. Our members should be able to identify the people behind FLYBODY and communicate with us about their fitness needs, questions and assistance.

Finally, on all pages, the footer has been separated into three equal columns. The first column includes information about the head office's location, phone number, hours of operation, and four social media connections. The second column lists additional FLYBODY gym locations as well as business hours on public holidays. The third column has a call to action button and a short headline that entices our users to sign up for our newsletter. The footer shows differently on different devices. The footer appears in three columns on a desktop and tablet, while only two columns appear on a mobile device. The Join our community column has been disabled to keep the website clean and to optimize our users' user experience.

When the subscribe call to action button is hit on a desktop and tablet , a form appears for the user to fill out in less than a minute. When the form is submitted, the user is would be directed to the thank you page informing users of the next action. Because of this, the subscribe call to action button is put in the footer because if the user has completed reading the home page and decides to cultivate a connection with FLYBODY, they can do so quickly through the footer.

##### RATES
Under the responsive navigation bar, the rates page has a hero image and an appealing text overlay. When you join FLYBODY's community, you can expect a lot of energy, as depicted by the banner image. This page displays the most cost-effective rates for the various memberships accessible to users of all classes. The user may quickly check the prices of all memberships on this page and choose one that fits their budget. 

A call to action button is located beneath the rates, inviting the user to sign up. When the button is pressed, a form appears, prompting the user to provide their contact information, email address, and preferred location. When the user has completed filling out their information, they can submit the form and be guided on the next action.  

Walk-ins are also welcome, and the price list is available. To maintain consistency across the site, we have a footer below the prices that has the same information as the home page footer and is shown the same manner on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. On all devices, the hero image, prices, and call to action button are responsive

##### TIMETABLE 

The timetable page has a fully responsive navigation bar with a hero image and text overlay beneath it. The hero image depicts a sneak peek into the treadmill area at one of FLYBODY's locations. This is utilized to make our web site more visually appealing to our users while also providing a sneak peek at the benefits of FLYBODY. 

The timetable for the classes provided at FLYBODY can be seen under the header for the months of august & September. The timetable is displayed in a table format, with the times (5AM to 9PM) on the top row and the days of the week on the left side column. These classes are also available online, and users can book them directly from their profile.

On a PC, the timetable is completely displayed, with lessons from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Sunday. The user can mouse over the classes to see what class is taking place and what time it is. The table helps the classes look concise and tidy. 
On a tablet and mobile device, the table shrinks, but the days of the week are still displayed in the left column, and the times are not fully displayed, but the user can horizontally scroll to see the remaining times of the classes. The horizontal scroll added to the table is due to the device's breakpoint width. The classes are still visible to the user as clear and succinct.

Finally, for the same reasons as the homepage and pricing page, the footer is positioned beneath the timetable.


##### INSTRUCTORS

A responsive navigation bar, as well as a hero image with an appealing text overlay, are featured, as are the other pages discussed, to capture our users' interest. In this part, we provide information to members and potential members about our employees, including their abilities and degree of expertise. This would make it easier for the user to find a trainer to fulfil their exercise needs. Outside, the user can readily identify/research these trainers to assess if they are professionals and trustworthy enough to communicate their fitness issues with. 

The user may easily visit our facility and choose a trainer because we offer thorough information on our trainers on our website.The images of the instructors take up four columns on a desktop, three columns on a tablet, and two columns on a mobile device, where they are all centred. This arrangement makes it easy for the reader to learn about each instructor without becoming overwhelmed. It appears clean and uncomplicated, allowing the viewer to more readily view information.  

Then there's the footer section, which appears beneath the instructors' images and contains the same message as the preceding pages and is displayed in the same manner as the homepage.

##### LOGIN

As with the previous pages, the header has a responsive navigation bar and a hero image with a text overlay. The hero image graphic displays a satisfied member working out at one of our facilities. The image's goal is to evoke a good emotion in our customers as they scroll down the page, as well as to help them imagine the experience they may expect at FLYBODY.

On a PC and a tablet, the body content of the login page is divided into two equal columns. The first column urges the user to register. It has an enticing header with a brief message and a call to action button for the user to sign up for an account. When the button is clicked, a form similar to the one used on the home page banner button appears. The goal of employing the pop up instead of redirecting the visitor to a new page is to speed up the decision-making process. As a result, it is used on the home page banner button.

The second column contains login credentials that must be filled out by a FLYBODY member, as well as a log In button. The user is required to enter their email address and password. A placeholder has been inserted in both text inputs to aid the user in entering the correct information After filling out all of the fields, the user can click the Log In button to access their portal, where they can book lessons, join the FLYBODY community, and track their fitness goals/progress. These are future implementations that will take place. However, for the time being, clicking the button will take the user to the home page. If a user forgets their password, they can easily click the link beneath the log in button and follow the instructions on the following page; for the time being, the link returns the user to the home page.

On a mobile device, the invitation to create an account takes up the entire width of the screen. The attractive header with the brief message also takes up the entire width, with the call to action button placed beneath it. The invitation and log in sections are separated by a short divider. The log in area is located beneath the divider and requires the user to enter their credentials before logging in to their portal. In the same way as the desktop and tablet views do, the user can retrieve a new password by clicking on the forgot password link. The designs were chosen to emphasize the content while also improving the user's reading and comprehension. 

Then there's the footer, which has the same information as the previous pages


##### JOIN US 

The page has a responsive navigation bar, just like the previous pages detailed above. Underneath it is a hero image with text overlay. The graphic is designed to pique the user's interest and encourage them to continue scrolling down the page. 

The hero image is followed by a contact form, which urges users to fill out the form in order to join the FLYBODY community. The user must provide their first and last names, email address, phone number, and preferred location. The user must then accept FLYBODY's terms and conditions before clicking the Sign Up button. On a PC or tablet, the form occupies 80% of the screen width; on a mobile device, it takes up the full screen. When the form is completed, the user is directed to the thank you page.

The footer is located beneath the form and conveys the same information as previously stated.

In the event that the user does not visit other pages to complete the form to begin their journey, this section allows them to quickly fill in their information to begin their journey with FLYBODY immediately.

##### THANK YOU PAGE 

This page, like the other ones, has a responsive navigation bar, but there is no alert dismissive message. The hero image is set in such a way that it draws the user into the FLYBODY experience. A quick message appears beneath the hero image, thanking the user for signing up with FLYBODY. Under the brief statement with the following steps, a smiley face has been inserted. This page tells the user of the next actions to take so that the user knows what to expect. This is done in order to improve the user's experience. This is used to improve the overall aesthetic of the site. 

The page also has a footer that contains the same information as before.

#### Acknowledgements

The inspiration for this project came from online research on different gym sites around the world, which was interesting because you could see how gym sites differed for different countries, regions and people. This was taken into account when developing the FLYBODY website for Nigeria.

I'd like to thank the tutor support team for their help with all of my questions, as well as for providing guidance or alternatives to resolve an issue. 

I'd also like to thank my mentor, Sammy Dartnall, for her ongoing feedback and advice on how to plan and carry out this project. Even with my poor internet connection during our meetings, she was very understanding and patient. Allowing the internet connection issue to have no impact on our meeting discussions.
