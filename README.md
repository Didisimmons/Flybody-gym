#FLYBODY

[Deployed site](https://didisimmons.github.io/Flybody-gym/)

#### Overview of project: 
FLYBODY is a fitness website in Nigeria designed to educate and inspire people about the benefits of fitness and good health. How incorporating an exercise routine into our daily lives might alter our way of life. One of the major issues that fitness websites face in the fitness industry is a lack of sufficient motivation for people to engage in memberships or join fitness programs/workouts.

However, a small fraction of people are eager to begin their fitness adventure. This is FLYBODYâ€™s  target audience; we understand that everyone has different goals, lifestyles and interests. There is no one-size-fits-all workout plan.As a result, we developed several programs to meet the needs of our clients.We are here to understand our clients'needs and provide them with the appropriate programs to assist them reach their various fitness objectives.

We recognize that embarking on a fitness journey can be intimidating at times, especially if you are unsure of what equipment to use or which exercise programs to take.As a result, we are committed to building a fitness community at FLYBODY that provides a safe,entertaining environment for people to bond and form genuine relationships. This community would be focused on inspiring one another to reach their fitness objectives, holding one another accountable, and providing support to one another. 

The website would foster a community in which people could constantly motivate one another and be proud of the benefits of being a member of a gym community.


## PROJECT GOAL 

FLYBODY is a website that encourages people to meet up for workout sessions or personal training on a regular basis. To create a community in which people can constantly motivate, socialize, and hold one another responsible for their fitness goals. The site would target people of all ages who want to stay fit, need motivation to get started, and are searching for a fitness community to join. FLYBODY would show the benefits of joining their community, how to join, and the advantages of FLYBODY over competitors.
